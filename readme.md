Complete project for ESP with the scenario:

```
Arkwrightâ€™s Allsorts is an independent stockist of DIY tools and equipment. They have computers in their warehouses but they are underpowered and basic and they require a prototype for a simple stock tracking system.

- The system must store the following details of products:

- Product ID (a seven-digit number)

- Name of product

- Department

- Location of the product in the Warehouse (a letter then a number e.g. A5)

- Quantity in stock.

- Price ex VAT

- Price inc VAT

The program must allow the user to search for a product by Name and Product ID. It must display the location of the product and the quantity in stock. If a staff member removes a product it must be removed from the quantity.

They have the following departments: Power tools, Power tool accessories, Hand tools, Tool storage, Measuring tools, Testing equipment, Heating & plumbing, electrical & lighting and screws, nails & fixings

The program must also allow the user to add new products to the system. The program must have a permanent data store.

You can assume, for now, that the user will enter correct data
```
